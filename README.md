# -Search-in-Blokus
This project focuses on implementing search algorithms for a simplified version of the strategy board game Blokus. Blokus involves placing uniquely shaped pieces on a grid, adhering to specific placement rules. The game is known for its strategic depth and spatial reasoning challenges. To familiarize yourself with the original game, we recommend reading its rules and playing it online against other players or computer opponents.
The primary goal of this project is to design and implement search algorithms to solve puzzles based on the game Blokus. These puzzles involve finding optimal placements of game pieces to achieve specific goals or maximize the score under certain constraints. The provided puzzles serve as benchmarks for evaluating the effectiveness and efficiency of your search algorithms.

Through this project, you will gain practical experience with key search techniques in artificial intelligence and computational problem solving, as well as insights into game-based decision-making.
